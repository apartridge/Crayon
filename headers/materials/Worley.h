/*!
    An implementation of the key cellular texturing basis
    function. This function is hardwired to return an average F_1 value
    of 1.0. It returns the <n> closest feature point distances
    F_1, F_2, .. F_n the vector delta to those points, and a 32 bit
    seed for each of the feature points.  This function is not
    difficult to extend to compute alternative information such as
    higher order F values, to use the Manhattan distance metric, or
    other fun perversions.
    
    <at>    The input sample location. 
    <maxOrder>  Smaller values compute faster. < 5, read the book to extend it.
    <F>     The output values of F_1, F_2, ..F[n] in F[0], F[1], F[n-1]
    <delta> The output vector difference between the sample point and the n-th
                closest feature point. Thus, the feature point's location is the
                hit point minus this value. The DERIVATIVE of F is the unit
                normalized version of this vector.
    <ID>    The output 32 bit ID number which labels the feature point. This
                is useful for domain partitions, especially for coloring flagstone
                patterns.
    
    This implementation is tuned for speed in a way that any order > 5
    will likely have discontinuous artifacts in its computation of F5+.
    This can be fixed by increasing the internal points-per-cube
    density in the source code, at the expense of slower
    computation. The book lists the details of this tuning.
